# Getting Started with gait

Welcome to gait, your intelligent companion for storing and sharing codegen prompts and conversations in VS Code or Cursor!

## Usage

### Drag Gait Panel to Right Side

We recommend dragging the gait panel to the right side of your screen, in the same group as Cursor's side panel.

1. Open the gait side view by clicking on the gait icon in the Activity Bar.
2. Use the Panel View to stage or unstage chats, similar to managing files in a Git commit.
3. **IMPORTANT**: when you commit, 

```
> git add .gait/
```


### Toggling Annotations (Hover and Highlight)

Use the keyboard shortcut `Cmd+Shift+G` to toggle full color highlights on and off.

### Continuing a Chat

1. Select a previous chat from the Panel View.
2. Click the "resume" button to continue the chat.
3. Gait will provide all necessary context, including prompts and context files, in a markdown file.
