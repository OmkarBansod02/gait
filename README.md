# gait

Welcome to gait, an extension for storing and sharing Github Copilot or Cursor prompts and conversations!

## Usage

### gait Automatically Records Cursor + Copilot Chats

No work on your end. There might be some delay! 

### AI blame: Viewing Chats

![Hover Demo](resources/hoverdemo3.gif)

Hover over AI-generated code to see the prompt that led to that particular code snippet. 
The other lines generated by that prompt get highlighted as well. **Prompts are like automatic documentation.** 

### Managing Chats: Stage, Unstage, and Delete

Chats that result in code get automatically written to file to be committed. If there's any reason you'd like to hide a chat, you can manually "stage" and "unstage" chats -  - **treat chats like diffs**.
1. Open the gait side view by clicking on the gait icon in the Activity Bar.
2. Use the Panel View to stage or unstage chats
3. **IMPORTANT**: when you commit, 

```
> git add .gait/
```


### Toggling Annotations (Hover and Highlight)

Use the keyboard shortcut `Cmd+Shift+G` to toggle full color highlights on and off.

### Continuing a Chat

1. Select a previous chat from the Panel View.
2. Click the "resume" button to continue the chat.
3. Gait will provide all necessary context, including prompts and context files, in a markdown file.

Latency - It takes some time for the metadata to show up for us to read in Cursor/Copilot!
Inline chats - We don't have a super clean way of capturing your diffs, they may be delayed or missing!
