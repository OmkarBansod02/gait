You should see the both chats in the Gait Panel under "Staged Chats"
Gait automatically stages all chats you have that result in a code change

Here, you can choose which prompts you want to stage/unstage, much like git!

Try generating a joke here! There might be a little delay before Gait captures it

Once it's generated, try unstaging/staging it through the plus/minus buttons, and then committing it!

Note that what was just in staged chats now appears in Committed Chats!

You can also continue off of conversations you've had before, just click the "Continue" button!
